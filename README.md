Installation Instructions:

Download both arcwin10-1.2.4.ps1 & arcwin10-1.2.4.bat to the same directory. Right click and run arcwin10-1.2.4.bat as Administrator.

Note: The auto updater in Arc does not work in Windows 10. You will need to run (from a command prompt) "taskkill /f /t /im arc.exe", and re-run arcwin10-1.2.4.bat as Administrator to update it.
